For this assignment, I would like you to create an animated scene that
builds from the code that I have attached. Your scene should include the
following elements. All of the elements described below are already present
in my example scene in some simple form. You should *not* just replicated
them. Instead, you should build something different and creative.

(1) Create at least one procedurally defined material in your index.html file,Â 
using the same addMaterial() method that I used to define the fog texture in
this example and the woodgrain texture from last week.

(2) Create your own example of using 2 link IK. For example, you could
implement a "pick and place" scene, in which a person or a robot reaches
then moves then places objects. Or you might make a walking person or
4 or 8 legged walking creature. Use your imagination.

(3) Use the aim() method somewhere in your scene to orient geometric parts
(maybe arms or legs).

(4) Use at least one spring. For example, if you are building a pick and
place scene, the object being picked up could respond to being moved in
some springy way.

(5) Make sure your scene can runs in stereo on your phone, using the library
that I have provided. You might try creating a scene that has things happening
in all around the viewer, so that someone looking at your scene will enjoy
looking around in different directions.
