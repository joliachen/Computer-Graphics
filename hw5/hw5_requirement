Since last week's assignment was very challenging, this week I am going to give you a break, in the form of a much easier (and fun) assignment.

Attached is the code that we went over in class this week. Your assignment is to use some combination of these shapes, transformed by time-varying matrices, to create your own original animated scene. Feel free to be creative and explore the artistic possibilities. Make creatures or spaceships or trees or houses or robots, or anything else that you can think of. Surprise and delight me (and yourself). Feel free to add procedural textures.

For extra credit, see if you can create shapes different than the ones we made in class. For example, can you make a regular icosahedron?
